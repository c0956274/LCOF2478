                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            Vase Mirage was born from a simple yet profound idea: to create vases that not only hold flowers but also capture moments and memories. Founded in 2015, our journey began in a small studio where passion and creativity fueled our designs. Over the years, we’ve grown into a trusted name, offering a diverse collection of handcrafted vases to customers around the globe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From our humble beginnings to becoming a celebrated brand, our story is one of dedication, innovation, and love for art. Each vase tells a story—of its creator, of its inspiration, and of the spaces it transforms. At Vase Mirage, we remain committed to our roots while embracing the future of design, ensuring that every piece we create continues to inspire joy and beauty.
                        </p>
